# Overview

This workshop is built to help you become familiar with using the Application Service. In this workshop, we'll work through topics like logging in, scaling, viewing logs, and high availability. At the end of this workshop, you should be comfortable with using `cf push` and navigating through the fundamental capabilities.

# Requirements
In order to be successful, you will need the following:
* An account on PWS Dark
* The sample app to deploy (found [HERE](/docs/pkg/attendees-sample-app.tgz))
* The `cf` CLI (found [HERE](/docs/pkg/cf-cli-6.51.0.zip))
